# SARBot - Surveillance and Rescue Bot

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Currently in simulation phase

SARBot is a low-cost surveillance and rescue robot designed for **flooded, earthquake-prone, and disaster-prone areas**, capable of:

- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Edge detection for avoiding falls
- Environmental monitoring (temperature and humidity)
- Alert mechanisms (buzzer and LED)
- Camera streaming 

This project uses **ESP32-CAM, ultrasonic sensor, IR sensor, DHT11, buzzer, and LED** to enable autonomous navigation in complex environments during rescue operations.

## How to Simulate and Test in Wokwi

### 1. Open the Project
- Import your `.ino` and `diagram.json` files into [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com).

### 2. Simulate Obstacle Detection
- Click the **Ultrasonic Sensor** in Wokwi.
- In the **Properties Panel (right side)**, change the **Distance** value to `15 cm`.
- SARBot will:
  - Stop motors
  - Trigger buzzer + LED alert
  - Turn right to avoid the obstacle

### 3. Simulate Edge Detection
- Click the **IR Sensor** in Wokwi.
- Press the **Button** on the IR module to simulate LOW state.
- SARBot will:
  - Stop motors immediately
  - Trigger buzzer + LED alert

### 4. Environmental Monitoring
- Click the **DHT11 Sensor**.
- Set **Temperature** and **Humidity** values in the Properties Panel.
- Observe these values printed in the Serial Monitor every 5 seconds.

### 5. Normal Forward Movement
- When:
  - Distance > 20 cm
  - IR sensor HIGH
- SARBot will move forward continuously.

## âš¡ Testing Checklist

âœ… Moves forward by default when clear  
âœ… Detects obstacles (< 20 cm), stops, alerts, and turns to avoid  
âœ… Detects edges, stops, and alerts  
âœ… Reads and prints temperature and humidity values  
âœ… Buzzer and LED function for alerts  
âœ… Serial monitor provides clean status updates
